  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (el-get 'sync 'dired-details)
  #+end_src
  

* Allow recursive delete, after asking for each directory at top level
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq dired-recursive-deletes 'top)
  #+end_src
  

* Copy recursively without asking
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq dired-recursive-copies 'always)
  #+end_src
  

* When in dired jump to start and end of directory listing (not the dired buffer)
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun dired-jump-to-bottom ()
      (interactive)
      (end-of-buffer)
      (dired-next-line -1))
    
    (defun dired-back-to-top ()
      (interactive)
      (beginning-of-buffer)
      (dired-next-line 4))
    
    (define-key dired-mode-map
      (vector 'remap 'beginning-of-buffer) 'dired-back-to-top)
    
    (define-key dired-mode-map
      (vector 'remap 'end-of-buffer) 'dired-jump-to-bottom)
  #+end_src


* Dired-details configuration
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

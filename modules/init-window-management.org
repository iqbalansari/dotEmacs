* Install workgroup2
  + [[https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2][workgroups2]]- Session manager for emacs, useful for creating workspaces as
                 well as saving restoring state (open buffers etc) on startup

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (el-get 'sync 'workgroups2)
  #+end_src

  
* Workgroups2 configurations
** Require workgroups2
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (load "workgroups2")
     (setq wg-use-default-session-file t)
   #+end_src   

** Save the session file in .emacs.d rather than home
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq wg-default-session-file "~/.emacs.d/workgroups")
   #+end_src

** Save automatically when exiting emacs  
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq wg-query-for-save-on-emacs-exit nil)
  #+end_src

** Key prefix for Workgroups2
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq wg-prefix-key (kbd "C-z"))    
   #+end_src

** Display current workgroup in modeline
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq wg-mode-line-display-on t)
   #+end_src
** Restore all buffers in workgroups
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq wg-restore-associated-buffers t)
   #+end_src

   
* Enable workgroups2
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (el-get 'sync 'switch-window)

  #+end_src


* Use default windmove bindings
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (windmove-default-keybindings 'super)
  #+end_src


* Keybindings to resize the windows
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

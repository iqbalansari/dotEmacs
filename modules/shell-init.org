* Install readline-complete to get auto-complete working in term
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (el-get 'sync 'readline-complete)

* Several settings needed to make readline-complete work
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq explicit-shell-file-name "bash")
    (setq explicit-bash-args '("-c" "export EMACS=; stty echo; bash"))
    (setq comint-process-echoes t)

* Setup readline-complete
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'readline-complete)
    
    (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'shell-mode)
    (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ac-rlc-setup-sources)
  #+end_src

* Set C-x as the prefix command rather than C-c also set keybindings to copy and yank in the term
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'term-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                ;; C-x is the prefix command, rather than C-c
                (term-set-escape-char ?\C-x)
                (define-key term-raw-map "\M-y" 'yank-pop)
                (define-key term-raw-map "\M-w" 'kill-ring-save)))

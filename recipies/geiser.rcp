       :description "Geiser is a collection of Emacs major and minor modes that conspire with one or more Scheme interpreters to keep the Lisp Machine Spirit alive. It draws inspiration (and a bit more) from environments such as Common Lisp's Slime, Factor's FUEL, Squeak or Emacs itself, and does its best to make Scheme hacking inside Emacs (even more) fun."

* Prefer executables provided by unxutils [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/]]
  Emacs relies on some external programs not available on windows for some of
  it's commands to work properly. Fortunately windows version of these programs
  are provided by some projects. Unxutils is one of them and seems to work best
  with emacs.
  
** Path of unxutils files
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defvar iqbal-unxutils-bin-dir (expand-file-name (locate-user-emacs-file "etc/unxutils/bin"))
       "Path to bin directory of Unxutils distribution")
     (defvar iqbal-unxutils-wbin-dir (expand-file-name (locate-user-emacs-file "etc/unxutils/usr/local/wbin"))
       "Path to usr/local/wbin directory of Unxutils distribution")
   #+end_src

** Add programs provided by unxutils to the exec-path and PATH
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (dolist (directory (list iqbal-unxutils-bin-dir iqbal-unxutils-wbin-dir))
       (when (equal system-type 'windows-nt)
         (add-to-list 'exec-path directory)
         (setenv "PATH" (mapconcat 'identity 
                                   (cons directory
                                         (split-string (getenv "PATH") path-separator))
                                   path-separator))))
   #+end_src

** Warn on absence of files
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defvar iqbal-windows-warn-abt-missing-unxutils t)

     (when (and iqbal-windows-warn-abt-missing-unxutils
                (not (file-exists-p iqbal-unxutils-wbin-dir)))
       (add-hook 'after-init-hook
                 (lambda ()
                   (warn (format "unxutils not found, please download it from `%s' and extract it to `%s' directory \
     otherwise some emacs commands might not work. If you have the files at some other location \
     set the variables `iqbal-unxutils-wbin-dir' and `iqbal-unxutils-bin-dir' to point to it. To \
